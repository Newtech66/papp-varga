- **TODO:** Use `noalias` appropriately
- ~~**TODO:** configure use of OpenMP~~ benchmarks indicate that openmp makes things worse in general. maybe the conjugate gradient could benefit from it idk
- ~~**TODO:** Use `EIGEN_NO_DEBUG` to disable assertions (?)~~ no effect in benchmarks
- **TODO:** Look into using conjugate gradient in matrix-free mode for the IHVP of `LogPerspecEpi`
